Django admin configuration for the 'search' application.

This module registers models from the 'search' application with the Django admin interface.
The `admin.py` file enables customization of how the models are displayed and interacted with in the Django admin dashboard.

Currently, the module doesn't include any custom configurations, but it serves as a place to add future admin customizations for the 'search' models.
