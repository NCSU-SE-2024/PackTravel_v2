Django App Configuration for the 'publish' app.

This module defines the configuration for the 'publish' application within the Django project. It inherits from `AppConfig`, which allows Django to manage and configure the app's settings during the startup of the project.

Attributes:
- `default_auto_field`: Specifies the default field type for auto-incrementing primary keys. In this case, it is set to `BigAutoField` which uses a 64-bit integer.
- `name`: The name of the application, which is 'publish'. This value should match the name of the application directory.

Usage:
- This configuration file is automatically recognized by Django when the app is added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the project settings.
