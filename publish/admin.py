Django Admin Configuration Module

This module registers the models for the Django admin interface, allowing administrators to manage and interact with the database models via the Django admin panel.

Currently, this module is empty, and the necessary models should be registered here for enhanced administrative capabilities.

Functions:
- Admin model registrations will be added here for the respective models when they are available in the project.

Usage:
- Once models are registered, they will be accessible through the Django admin interface for CRUD operations.
