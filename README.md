### Issues in Previous Phase - 

- **Login and Logout Functionality**: The login and logout features were not functioning as expected; clicking on them did not trigger any action.
- **Unauthenticated Access**: Users were able to access several features, such as creating or searching for rides, without being logged in.
- **Homepage Background Image**: The background image on the homepage was not displaying correctly.
- **Database Updates**: The Users and Routes databases were not being updated properly.
- **Redirection After Login**: After logging in, users were not redirected to the correct homepage. Instead, they were directed to an index page.
- **Test Cases and Code Coverage**: The application lacked sufficient test cases, and the code coverage was inadequate, which limits the ability to detect errors and ensure system reliability.
- **Documentation Issues**: Several Python files lacked proper documentation, making it difficult to understand the code and its functionality.
